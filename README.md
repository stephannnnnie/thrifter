# thrifter
## Inspiration
Thrifting not only makes fashion more affordable but also promotes sustainability by encouraging people to purchase second-hand clothing instead of fast fashion items. Our goal was to create a platform that makes second-hand shopping more personalized and enjoyable.

## What it does
Thrifter is a second-hand clothing platform specifically designed for women's fashion. Unlike general second-hand marketplaces like eBay, Thrifter offers a curated shopping experience by showing users only the items that match their style preferences.

## How we built it
We built Thrifter's front end using HTML and CSS, while the initial design was created using Figma. The backend relies on MongoDB to store and manage product listings and user preferences.

## Challenges we ran into
One major challenge was connecting the MongoDB backend to the front end. Our custom API did not work correctly at first, making data flow between the front end and back end inconsistent. Additionally, creating the matching algorithm to personalize item recommendations proved difficult, as it initially lacked the level of customization we aimed for.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully created a minimalist website that aligns with our vision of promoting sustainable fashion. Despite the challenges, our team worked collaboratively to integrate the front end and back end, ultimately delivering a functioning product.

## What we learned
Throughout this project, we learned the importance of clear communication when collaborating on both front-end and back-end development. Consistent naming conventions and uniform function structures played a key role in streamlining the integration process.

## What's next for Thrifter 
Our next step is to introduce outfit-matching features that recommend complete looks based on user preferences. Additionally, we plan to implement a virtual model feature, allowing users to see how outfits would look on different body types.
